# Final project
## Detection-of-violence-against-children-in-videos
This project proposes a physical violence detecting method based on indoor surveillance cameras. The cameras capture video streams, these streams are classified by using a deep- learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approach for violence detection by learning the detailed features in videos. CNN is used for
feature extraction and LSTM is used to classify video based on those features. As a CNN feature extraction we use ResNet152V2 pre-trained model.
